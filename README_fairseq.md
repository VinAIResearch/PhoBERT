# PhoBERT: Pre-trained language models for Vietnamese <a name="introduction"></a>

Pre-trained PhoBERT models are the state-of-the-art language models for Vietnamese ([Pho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho), i.e. "Phở", is a popular food in Vietnam): 

 - Two PhoBERT versions of "base" and "large" are the first public large-scale monolingual language models pre-trained for Vietnamese. PhoBERT pre-training approach is based on [RoBERTa](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/examples/roberta/README.md)  which optimizes the [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert) pre-training procedure for more robust performance.
 - PhoBERT outperforms previous monolingual and multilingual approaches, obtaining new state-of-the-art performances on four downstream Vietnamese NLP tasks of Part-of-speech tagging, Dependency parsing, Named-entity recognition and Natural language inference.

The general architecture and experimental results of PhoBERT can be found in our [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.92/):

### Example usage <a name="usage1"></a>

_Assume that the input texts are already word-segmented!_

```python
import torch

# Load PhoBERT-base in fairseq
from fairseq.models.roberta import RobertaModel
bpe_codes_file = '/Absolute-path-to/PhoBERT_base_fairseq/bpe.codes'
phobert = RobertaModel.from_pretrained('/Absolute-path-to/PhoBERT_base_fairseq', checkpoint_file='model.pt', bpe='fastbpe', bpe_codes=bpe_codes_file).eval()

# INPUT TEXT IS WORD-SEGMENTED!
line = "Tôi là sinh_viên trường đại_học Công_nghệ ."  

# Extract the last layer's features  
subwords = phobert.encode(line)  
last_layer_features = phobert.extract_features(subwords)  
assert last_layer_features.size() == torch.Size([1, 9, 768])  
  
# Extract all layer's features (layer 0 is the embedding layer)  
all_layers = phobert.extract_features(subwords, return_all_hiddens=True)  
assert len(all_layers) == 13  
assert torch.all(all_layers[-1] == last_layer_features)  

# Filling marks  
masked_line = 'Tôi là  <mask> trường đại_học Công_nghệ .'  
topk_filled_outputs = phobert.fill_mask(masked_line, topk=5)  
print(topk_filled_outputs)

```
